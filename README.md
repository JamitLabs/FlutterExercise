# Flutter ToDo Example

An example todo app to demonstrate app building with Flutter. 
It uses simple Flutter concepts to build UI with widgets and demonstrate state management.

## Setup 
### Flutter Setup:

- Install Flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
- Setup IDE. We suggest to use Android Studio or VS Code: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor
- Create an example project or checkout this repo to test the setup: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=terminal
- Setup Emulator. You need at least one emulator:
    - Android Emulator via Android Studio
    - iOS simulator via XCode (only works on MacBooks)
    - Browser (no specific requirements)
    - Macos/Windows/Linux (depends on your system)
- Start the example project

## Tasks 
This app is designed to be used with two tasks. 
The starting point for the tasks is contained in the `home_page.dart` file which is automatically included in the `main.dart` file. 

### Task 1: Search
Add a search bar to filter the todo items based on the search input.

An example solution will be published shortly after the session. It can be found in the `home_page_task1_solution.dart`. Simply replace the import in `main.dart` with the corresponding solution file to use the solutions.


### Task 2: Filter 
Add a filter to filter the todo items based on the done state.

An example solution will be published shortly after the session. It can be found in the `home_page_task2_solution.dart`. Simply replace the import in `main.dart` with the corresponding solution file to use the solutions.
